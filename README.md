# AE-Cases
Laser cut and engrave files for AE Modular format cases.

The [AE-1x12U Case design (Mk1)](https://github.com/clectric-diy/AE-Cases/releases/tag/Mk1) is finished and ready to cut. Remember to do material and kerf tests to be sure that your laser settings are dialed in. These were designed to be cut on a 20W Longer RAY5 diode laser.

The [AE-3x8U](https://github.com/clectric-diy/AE-Cases/tree/main/AE-3x8U) Case is still in development. It is an experiment to have an open board design to be used inside other enclosures.
